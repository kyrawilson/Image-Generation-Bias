## Image-Generation-Bias

This repo contains code and data for our paper [Bias Amplification in Stable Diffusionâ€™s Representation of Stigma Through Skin Tones and Their Homogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17465) published at AIES 2025.

### Experiment 1

To extract skin tone regions from generated images of faces, run the script ```masks.py``` (adapted from [Or-El et al. 2020's implementation](https://github.com/stupidcucumber/DeepLabV3-CelebHQ/blob/main/eval.py)).

```
python masks.py 

options:
  -m, --model           Name of T2I model
  -i, --images-dir      Path to the folder of generated images
  -a, --masks-dir       Path to the folder of masks
  -r, --results-dir     Path to save results
```

Run the script ```skin_tones.py``` (adapted from [Thong et al. (2023)'s implementation](https://github.com/SonyResearch/apparent_skincolor/blob/main/extract/predict.py)) to calculate luminance (_L*_) and hue (_h*_) for generated images. 

```
python skin_tones.py -m 'SDXL' -i 'data/images/SDXL' -a 'data/masks/SDXL' -r 'data/results'

options:
  -m, --model           Name of T2I model
  -i, --images-dir      Path to the folder of generated images
  -a, --masks-dir       Path to the folder of masks
  -r, --results-dir     Path to save results
```

### Experiment 2

For human face datasets, we use the results of skin tone analysis provided by Thong et al. (2023) available in their [project repository](https://github.com/SonyResearch/apparent_skincolor/blob/main/extract/results). 

### Experiment 3

_Calculating delta E..._

### Experiment 4

_Case study of stigmatized racial identities..._
